Synchronization
-------------------

StackEdit can be combined with <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i>
**Google Drive** and <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox**
to have your documents saved in the *Cloud*. The synchronization
mechanism takes care of uploading your modifications or downloading the
latest version of your documents.

> **Note:**

> - Full access to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** is required to be
> able to import any document in StackEdit. Permission restrictions can
> be configured in the settings.
> - Imported documents are downloaded in your browser and are not
> transmitted to a server.
> - If you experience problems saving your documents on Google Drive,
> check and optionally disable browser extensions, such as Disconnect.
